# Electron + React + TypeScript Template App: Plan

## Overview
This project is a minimal template for building desktop applications using Electron, React, and TypeScript. The goal is to demonstrate best practices for structuring such an app, while keeping it simple and easy to understand.

## Key Decisions
- **Frontend Build Tool:** Vite (not Create React App)
- **Package Manager:** npm (not yarn)
- **Directory Structure:**
  - Electron main process code in the project root (e.g., `main.ts`)
  - React + TypeScript renderer in `/renderer` (created by Vite)
- **TypeScript:** Used for both Electron main and React renderer processes
- **Build & Run:** Vite builds the renderer, Electron loads the built files
- **Scripts:** All commands and scripts will use npm

## Steps

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up the project directory and initialize with npm.
   - Add a .gitignore file.
   - Configure TypeScript for both main and renderer processes.

2. **Electron Main Process**
   - Create the main process entry point (`main.ts`) in the project root.
   - Configure Electron to load the React app from the Vite build output.

3. **React + TypeScript Renderer**
   - Set up the React app with TypeScript using Vite.
   - Organize the renderer code in a `renderer` directory.

4. **IPC & Communication**
   - Demonstrate basic communication between Electron main and renderer processes using IPC.

5. **Best Practices & Documentation**
   - Add comments and structure the code for clarity.
   - Document the project structure and how to run/build the app.

## Incremental Approach
After each step, I will check in for your feedback before proceeding.
